Investment Club
========

What is the investment club?
-------
The investment club is a group whose goal is to enable retailers to trade the markets (traditional and crypto) using the full suite of Vectorspace AI offerings. It will operate on the long and short side at the same time. This means positioning across thematic baskets that are long, short and long/short. It's the best way to transition into a downturn, when one arrives.

As an investment club as defined by the US SEC, trades are decided upon by the club or group. In some cases, algos can decide on the trades if the group agrees. 
Please keep in mind that all details about the investment club arenâ€™t released yet, but will be in the near future.
