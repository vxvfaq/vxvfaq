What is Vectorspace AI?
--------

Vectorspace AI is a data-focused crypto startup, the easiest way to understand what we would be to jump right into it by observing a real-life event that resulted in an opportunity to profit based on our Natural Language Processing and Understanding (NLP/NLU) real-time datasets and connected to what is called ‘information arbitrage’.
Our platform, which includes datasets and products that can be built on top of them, enable known and hidden relationship detection in data. Our datasets can be used to cluster entities that have known and hidden relationships to outside events, global trends or news. These clusters can represent networks of suppliers, companies working on similar drugs or any entity that might have symbiotic, parasitic or sympathetic latent entanglement with another entity, event or global trend.

What is the total supply of VXV?
--------

50,000,000 VXV

What is the current circulating supply of VXV?
------------

We need to subtract the amount in the team’s wallet from the total supply, so:
50,000,000 VXV – ~18,500,000 VXV = ~31,500,000 VXV, updated on 02/13/2020.

When will the correct circulating supply be reflected on Coinmarketcap, Coingecko etc.?
----------

We are aware of it, and we are working to get this updated in compliance with CMC’s criteria for listing the circulating supply.

What is the current market cap of VXV?
-------

We need to multiply the current circulating supply by the current token price, so:
~31,500,000 VXV * $0.78 = $24,570,000, updated on 02/13/2020.

Was there an ICO?
-------

No, there was no ICO. Around $700k was raised by angel investors, family and friends.

How can the company run for over 3 years with limited raised capital?
-------

We have run startups before and with a burn of $650k per month. We also know how to run very lean and scrappy. In part, we can do this because we are working on tip of the spear science and technology which attracts talent for reasons beyond the cash.
All of the heavy work is already done. As a team we like doing the hard parts first. This is the reason we have multiple products releases now and in the past. A to Z execution, that is what our track record shows.
We adapt to cheap, low maintenance and smart money along with the market and our customers. This means we operate on their schedules not our own.

What is the token distribution?
-------

The team`s founding tokens have a 4 years lockup period. Only team members and certain partners are locked or vested. We will have more updates on the number of locked/vested tokens in the future.

Is there an updated roadmap?
-------

We provide an updated roadmap once a week on Monday at 1pm PST after the traditional markets close in the form of a corporate executive conference call. The calls are available in the main Telegram group and in our site, in this link: https://vectorspace.ai/conf-calls.html
