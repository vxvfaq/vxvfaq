Overview

What is Vectorspace AI?
--------

Vectorspace AI is a data-focused crypto startup, the easiest way to understand what we would be to jump right into it by observing a real-life event that resulted in an opportunity to profit based on our Natural Language Processing and Understanding (NLP/NLU) real-time datasets and connected to what is called ‘information arbitrage’.
Our platform, which includes datasets and products that can be built on top of them, enable known and hidden relationship detection in data. Our datasets can be used to cluster entities that have known and hidden relationships to outside events, global trends or news. These clusters can represent networks of suppliers, companies working on similar drugs or any entity that might have symbiotic, parasitic or sympathetic latent entanglement with another entity, event or global trend.

Where is Vectorspace AI located?
-------

Vectorspace AI is located in San Francisco, CA and Valletta, Malta.

When was Vectorspace AI founded?
-------

January 2017.

What is the token symbol?
-------

The symbol is VXV and the token address is: 0x7D29A64504629172a429e64183D6673b9dAcbFCe

https://etherscan.io/token/0x7D29A64504629172a429e64183D6673b9dAcbFCe

When was VXV token created?
-------

08/04/2018 08:42:33 PM +UTC

Is there an updated roadmap?
-------

We provide an updated roadmap once a week on Monday at 1pm PST after the traditional markets close in the form of a corporate executive conference call. The calls are available in the main Telegram group and in our site, in this link: https://vectorspace.ai/conf-calls.html

Is the team planning on building a new website and possibly touching up the branding?
-------

Google made it to the number one brand in the world with a simple interface. We are in the business of data engineering and our branding is geared towards attracting revenue generating customers in data fields in the industry. This may happen at a later time but is not a priority at the moment.

Tokenomics
========

What is the total supply of VXV?
--------

50,000,000 VXV

What is the current circulating supply of VXV?
------------

We need to subtract the amount in the team’s wallet from the total supply, so:
50,000,000 VXV – ~18,500,000 VXV = ~31,500,000 VXV, updated on 02/13/2021.

When will the correct circulating supply be reflected on Coinmarketcap, Coingecko etc.?
----------

We are aware of it, and we are working to get this updated in compliance with CMC’s criteria for listing the circulating supply.

What is the current market cap of VXV?
-------

We need to multiply the current circulating supply by the current token price, so:
~31,500,000 VXV * $0.78 = $24,570,000, updated on 02/13/2021.

Was there an ICO?
-------

No, there was no ICO. Around $700k was raised by angel investors, family and friends.

How can the company run for over 3 years with limited raised capital?
-------

We have run startups before and with a burn of $650k per month. We also know how to run very lean and scrappy. In part, we can do this because we are working on tip of the spear science and technology which attracts talent for reasons beyond the cash.

All of the heavy work is already done. As a team we like doing the hard parts first. This is the reason we have multiple products releases now and in the past. A to Z execution, that is what our track record shows.

We adapt to cheap, low maintenance and smart money along with the market and our customers. This means we operate on their schedules not our own.

What is the token distribution?
-------

.. image:: https://github.com/vxvfaq/vxvfaq/blob/master/img/distribution.png
   :width: 600 

The team`s founding tokens have a 4 years lockup period. Only team members and certain partners are locked or vested. We will have more updates on the number of locked/vested tokens in the future.

How often does the circulating supply increase?
-------

The supply is only to increase when absolutely necessary. We know a healthy amount about the dynamics of circulating supplies and its effects on price movements – this is called the ‘float’ in the traditional markets and you want your float as low as possible and not bloated. The majority of cryptos out there have far too many of their tokens in their circulating supply and that prevents them from running. This also connects to how your overall capitalization table is structured.

We are not a typical crypto “team”. We function as a startup similar to the ones you find in Silicon Valley. We plan to use the founding team’s tokens to move the company forward in any way necessary, including engineering, strategic IR/PR, customer support and whatever it takes to get to revenue and then profitability.

What is the purpose of the VXV token?
-------

The token can be used to pay for a subscription to access Vectorspace AI’s services, although customers can also pay for these subscriptions with USD, ETH, or BTC. Beyond payments, the tokens wallet address serves as an API key for the distribution of datasets. From a software engineering standpoint wallet addresses function exactly the same way API keys do. This allows the distribution of datasets to be seamless and allows our customers to utilize the highest level of data integrity. Finally, and arguably most importantly, the token is utilized in our Data Provenance Pipeline.

Data Provenance is essentially the life cycle of data. It is used to track the origin of data, the source of data, what computations were conducted on that data, and provides the framework for troubleshooting issues amongst datasets. On a blockchain, all transactions are natively hashed. This means that our data provenance pipeline has the highest level of data integrity and transparency. As an added bonus, the native hashing on blockchains makes the troubleshooting cycle much easier by allowing developers to easily identify duplicate data sources or discover issues in the calculation of their datasets. We understand that crypto currencies are difficult to utilize and we have made it easy for our customers to utilize the benefits without having to deal with their own custody via our partnership with Trustology.

Why do the team’s tokens move to a new wallet from time to time?
-------

We follow proper security protocol and industry standards. Everyone should also be changing their passwords from time to time in addition to using a password manager if necessary. We started enforcing proper security protocol and information security back in the early days because we know that the greatest attack vector relates to social engineering. The objective is to eliminate as many attack vectors as you possibly can.

Can the team provide clarification on the strategic selling by the team from the main wallet?
-------

There is no strategic selling by the main wallet. What is occurring is called capital raising. In fact, the entire financial market around the world is based around capital raising (hence why they are called capital markets). One of the reasons why public companies exist is by raising capital through the public. Questions around movement of funds from the wallet are at the discretion of the team in relation to capital, deals, etc. This is a complex process, and it is recommended to look up Paul Graham for a background as to why companies raise capital.

Why did Vectorspace AI go the crypto route as opposed to traditional business routes?
-------

“How Apple Influenced The Labels To Shut Down My Music Streaming Startup”
https://medium.com/startup-frontier/steve-jobs-made-warner-music-sue-my-startup-9a81c5a21d68
We had an offer for $120M for the company, then the economy crashed and while we were being litigated for $40 BILLION dollars brought on by Apple, Warner and EMI. So, we wound it down. Another thing happened when we had that offer, my investors started to try to push the negotiations higher and the other group started arguing with my investor about valuation while I was sitting right there. After that I decided that I would not let the valuation of my company be haggled over by 3 or for guys, I want the public to set the valuation of my next company. So, I got a public company listed and it was called Mimvi. This time I was going to have public market exposure and the ability to raise capital from the capital markets. It was hard to do but we got It done and eventually got it fully liquid by doing an investment deal with MSFT. However, we were restricted from doing many more things that we thought we could do based on over regulation of smaller companies vs the larger ones. We also ran into a few crooks. This is the other path we have taken.

We gave it more thought and made a move into crypto in 2014 with something we called SongCoin, we were all over the media based on what we announced we were going to do for the music industry, you can read about it if you do a search for “songcoin pimovi”. Long story short our investor got panicked by what was happening in crypto with Mt. Gox and all. He was a 74-year-old Aussie named Max Grant. He ran a small traditional OTC company where its only assets were 4 or 5 oil wells down under and in Texas. He wanted me to start Pimovi and we would work together on SongCoin. He completed the financing but got spooked. So, we waited while one of the founding soft devs on the Namecoin team, Dylan Durst and myself spent a week at my house properly forking Bitcoin to SongCoin, full compiles. We needed funding to build wallets because back then, you had to build many things from scratch because nobody had any stable code worth using. We stopped work to try to figure out what we were going to do to protect this project. Meanwhile a guy named Michael Prince forked bitcoin and labeled it SongCoin – he basically ripped us off and he listed on Cryptopia and got CMC to start quoting him. I approached him in email and have the thread if anyone would like to see. At any rate, we hunkered down while BTC was crashing and then I was approached by my original SeeqPod investor. He asked what I was up to and I mentioned NLP and bots, maybe bots that teach people how to buy crypto. He then said “what is crypto” so I told him to go to coinmarketcap.com and call, then we can talk about what I am doing. So, I get a call from him at 5:30am the next morning and his excitement level is off the charts. He then asked if I could start a crypto company.

We started a company called Starmine.ai – it was designed to be a dataset company pure and simple. Long story short on this one, our investor got spooked by how traceable everything is on the blockchain and never came through with the funding so I took the team and the company and said, we are going to start vectorspace.ai and rely on smarter investors while we beef up the dataset side and add more feature vector options with real-time data, and here we are, sitting here with all you fine folks.
While we were doing all of the above in 2014-2017, we were also consulting for a hedge fund, Artiman Capital in Palo Alto CA.

We also have a background in the financial markets based on the aggleonal going back since 1997 when I made my first trade which was 2000 shares of SCOC, (Santa Cruz Operations) they were trying to make money on licensing their version of Unix called Xenix, which I was learning at the time as well. We ran it in a small real estate management firm called K&S in Albany which is next door to Berkeley where I grew up born and raised, several generations back. My uncle was a mechanical engineer in Idaho and my dad was a tinkerer. They got together one time and though it would be a good idea if they bought us a clone computer that we would put together ourselves. I got 4 of them and only got 1 working. Long story short, we have a deep history in software engineering and data engineering. Specialties in machine learning and data engineering combined with a deep knowledge of the financial markets, we think crypto is the perfect vehicle for exposing a trading vehicle to a truly global marketplace. We want to combine AI with crypto in a smart way and we think we have done so.

We have also moved a lot of money around in the traditional markets and we have helped people including hedge funds and family offices to move money in smart ways. It boosts our reputation which is good because they are back when we need them.

We are here because we want to see trading vehicles attached to valuable innovations.

We want to see valuable innovations have access or be able to raise capital from the new crypto capital markets because the traditional capital markets can be too exclusive while also the small caps take the brunt of regulation while the large caps get slaps on the wrist. We also saw a ton of manipulation in ways you could not believe as I have described in detail here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13844765

That is another reason, we are in crypto because we like transparency.

What is the current exchange listing strategy?
-------

Our exchange strategy involves being listed on a tier-1 exchange, e.g., Kraken or KuCoin, available in the USA and another one to serve the Asian markets.

Why did the token get delisted from IDEX in January 2020?
-------

We requested IDEX to delist our token. This related to what our customers (hedge funds, asset management companies, traders and investors) were concerned with which connects to U.S. customers accessing through the Tor browser along with bot arbitrage against their position with VXV. 

We have extracted some data points from this strategic maneuver and have since relisted on IDEX (July 2020).

Technology
========

What does Vectorspace AI offer, in layman’s terms?
-------

Vectorspace AI’s algorithms look at data and find hidden similarities which can be applied to many types of businesses. We algorithmically generate millions of dataset permutations in real-time. These datasets are the ‘gasoline’ used to power unsupervised learning approaches in AI/ML. Specifically, they are used to:

A) make money, a.k.a generate or protect alpha on the long and short side with traditionals and cryptos. For instance, hedge funds would use it to monitor stock prices - if Vectorspace AI finds that when X stock price rises/falls, Y and Z also fall. The fund manager can then react before that happens to avoid losing money.

“Generating Alpha from Information Arbitrage in the Financial Markets with NLP Datasets: 水涨船高”
https://medium.com/hackernoon/profiting-from-information-arbitrage-in-the-financial-markets-3abfca9806d8

B) increase the speed of innovation, novel scientific breakthroughs and enable scientific discoveries. Similarly, for a pharmaceutical company, Vectorspace AI could identify hidden and non-hidden relationships between the effects of drug compounds on certain conditions. In other words, Information that shows drug X, which is used to treat a condition, actually has benefited many patients with different conditions - or just as importantly, has a poor outcome for patients with certain conditions. In effect the “Smart Baskets” give companies a huge early advantage (known as information arbitrage or alpha).

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/covid-19-drug-repurposing-datasets-now-available-in-collaboration-with-vectorspace-ai-amazon--microsoft-301030507.html 

COVID-19 Dataset Builder: https://vectorspace.ai/covid19.html 

Vectorspace AI services more than just the financial vertical defined by cryptos and traditional market vehicles. Our platform has applications in almost all industry verticals.

Why is the code not open source?
-------

Github is private to protect algorithms and code. We have been software engineers since we have been kids in the 80’s. We are not going to allow other organizations pretend they are auditing our code while also paying them tons of ETH. That is one reason.

From our CEO: “I have dealt with my fair share of outside auditors while running a public company. I have also been through a few major software audits run by security firms (which we have done work for in the past) and standard software auditing done by firms like PwC. Auditing software is completely different from auditing your books.”

What are Smart Baskets?
-------

Smart Baskets are the product of indexed entities such as stocks, cryptos, drug compounds, etc. that are grouped by a similar theme, enabling thematic investing, i.e., the ability to invest in prominent trends or themes. In doing so, we are able to extrapolate hidden relationships based on proprietary Natural Language Processing and Understanding (NLP/NLU) datasets. Baskets of cryptocurrencies or stocks are algorithmically generated based on a news event, topic or 'special situation' often used by internal market researchers inside hedge funds/asset management companies.

How are Smart Baskets generated?
-------

Smart Baskets are generated based on an event, global trend or concept using our real-time NLU correlation matrix datasets. They are smart because they are automatically generated based on NLU datasets. For instance, our clients choose a customized dataset with a custom sector of equities and a custom set of topics, trends, categories, pre-select events, or real-time events. A basket is generated and then they choose how they want to filter that basket which can be done in a million different ways.

Will the Smart Baskets be available to the public as well as institutions?
-------

Yes, these will be available for traditional retail traders as well i.e., crypto traders. The larger customers will typically access more advanced versions of these Smart Baskets based on the tiered pricing.

Smart Baskets is a known term within the trading community. Would it be a good marketing move to rename Vectorspace AI’s Smart Baskets to a term with exclusivity to Vectorspace AI?
-------

This makes sense, but based on our experience with branding, there are advantages and disadvantages to branding collisions. We rebranded in the past from Starmine. This is a common practice.

I read that the Smart Baskets will be exclusively developed for LCX. Is this a good strategy? 
-------

Smart Basket technology comes in many different forms which are built on datasets. These datasets have billions of permutations, so if a class of datasets supports a group of Smart Baskets, then the team can make that exclusive. We are in the process of negotiating a variety of exclusive licenses related to aspects of our technology.

Does Vectorspace AI test the Smart Baskets with a high variance in position size?
-------

Yes, we have done this with a group before. We had a chance to test baskets with a few million dollars in capital per basket. One of our goals is to support deploying a large amount of capital.

What is the upper limit of position sizes that Vectorspace AI tested/back-tested?
-------

We have tested in simulated markets with 1 million dollars per basket. You can back test and test in a simulated market environment with buy and sell pressure but this is nothing like the real thing. The real markets are slightly different which is why we plan to trade our internal proprietary baskets ourselves.

In an unfiltered basket do the stock ticker symbols come up in any specific order, i.e., from best option to worst or vice versa? In other words, would the best one show up 1st in line?
-------

Yes, they are ranked/scored based on the strength of the relationship. They are unfiltered because the relationships are not context controlled or directional.

Long baskets were discarded due to COVID-19 making it not viable, but we are currently seeing retail investors making a killing with Robinhood buying bankrupt companies. Would this new environment make long baskets not far more attractive than short baskets?
-------

The first reason is because anytime you see someone making money based off of chapter 11 plays (bankruptcies), this is a chance play. These are not worth playing as it is a gamble. When you look at long baskets, they are not something we are focused on at this time. We started generating long Smart Baskets for the crypto markets which crashed. We then moved into datasets for every industry. Then we had an economic crash which resulted in a shift to short plays. The investment club will offer baskets for shorts on the traditionals side. Baskets are certainly available, and in this environment, we see them as being a big opportunity which we are prepared for. Institutions and retail will be offered to the opportunity to short traditionals.

The Coronavirus basket (COVID-19) resulted in a multitude of long opportunities. The secret sauce to Smart Baskets is the ability to take a Smart Basket and filter them by criteria of context to create two groups that allow you to go short and long. Creating that separation or filters is the goal. Data is the unrefined crude oil, while datasets are the refined petroleum that power AI systems. The dataset augmentation part is important because it allows data engineering pipelines to take their datasets and append them with Vectorspace AI NLP datasets. This will allow them to create new clusters/correlations as to why things are occurring.

Financials
========

What is the revenue model?
-------

We offer a paid subscription where we have dozens of different tiered levels of service offerings, similar to Netflix, mixed with Amazon, but for datasets. We offer $0.99c updates per dataset per data source per minute per context which drives the revenue model. 

Customers can pay in fiat or crypto (BTC/ETH), then 50% of the subscription value will be bought in VXV on the open market that will be placed in the customer’s wallet and assigned to a number of services (dataset, Smart Baskets etc.). As they use the services, the VXV is used up. For instance, generating Smart Baskets from the datasets to find hidden correlations using the Vectorspace AI algorithms uses up the VXV. They are then locked up for a period of time. This period of time has yet to be determined.

The other 50% will work as a “fee” that translates to revenue. Revenue will be used to build the company which increases its valuation and impact in the world. We are sharing the fee. It is like a revenue share with the public. Please note that the percentage of the “fee” is adjustable, so it could be changed in the future.

Some might sign up for datasets and some sign up for datasets that have pre-generated Smart Baskets they can immediately trade. Datasets -> clusters -> Smart Baskets of all kinds. 

Imagine company A pays Vectorspace AI 100k$ per month for certain datasets that are updated at a certain frequency. 

Behind the scenes, 50% of that flows to Vectorspace AI to pay for operating costs and expansion. It is gross revenue.

The other 50% is used to set limited buy orders on the open market for VXV at certain price levels. 

This creates liquidity pools at these price levels. If someone sells, these orders can get triggered. If these limited buy orders are triggered, 50% goes to Vectorspace AI, and 50% to a customer wallet. This customer wallet is controlled by Vectorspace AI, through our partner Trustology. By having the customer wallet, the circulating supply of VXV is reduced.

This process can change as needed.

A revenue projection can be seen on page 14 of our deck: 
https://vectorspace.ai/assets/VXV_Deck_External.pdf

Why is the token valuable?
-------

The value created by our community which includes the core team, the outside team and contributing members of our global community, translates directly into the value of the VXV utility token and as a global public trading vehicle.

VXV utility tokens do not function like a security or currency and share only minor similarities with e.g., Google Cloud credits, AWS credits, or WeWork utility credits due to VXV doubling as a public trading vehicle in a global public marketplace.

Our top-tier proprietary datasets and algorithms deployed in the financial markets that enable asset management groups, hedge funds and institutions to generate and capture alpha, can only be used by a limited number of customers. In this business, it is a common requirement from our top-tier customers to prevent saturating the market. It is like giving everybody the exact same weapons. This means the value of VXV is controlled by our customers, who will also be taking long term positions in VXV. It only makes sense and it is out of our control.

In order to serve our customers properly, we have carved out a public marketplace which allows them to acquire blocks of VXV and out-bid other customers if they would like to ‘corner the market’ on particular proprietary datasets. 

The VXV utility token credit also doubles as a global public trading vehicle available to be transacted, acquired, bought and sold between anyone, including speculators, in the global public crypto markets via exchanges. This means a farmer in Kenya or a villager in Borneo can acquire VXV to access a dataset one minute and resell VXV to a trillion-dollar asset management company the next minute in exchange for “JPM coin” for example. This is completely out of our control.

As mentioned in question 30, we have plans on enabling machines (data engineering pipelines onsite at customer locations) to transact VXV with one another for the purpose of ‘minimizing loss’ which is at the core of effective ML/AI.

What is Vectorspace AI’s total addressable market?
-------

Billions. This is because we are a data company with a focus on revenue generating customers, which are trillion-dollar asset management companies, funds and other financial institutions. Our job is to help them make money by providing them with an edge. This happens based on our product, NLP/NLU on-demand datasets that are updated every minute and based on any data they choose. 

This includes transacting dataset updates along with our Data Pipeline Provenance (DPP) hash which controls data lineage (a.k.a data provenance). Knowing where your data comes from and knowing how reliable it is, is extremely important to financial institutions that rely on it to make billion-dollar decisions every day. We give financial institutions an edge that to them, is worth billions. Here we are talking about one example in the finance industry, but our platform has applications in almost all industry verticals. 

What is the upper limit of dataset updates/combinations Vectorspace AI can provide?
-------

We currently charge $0.99c per dataset per update. We have an infinite combination of dataset permutations, combinations, and customizations. Our data engineering pipelines are being prepared to scale toward updating deltas per dataset permutations which would mean anytime a data point changes it gets reflected in the dataset. This level of customization is available today on a case-by-case basis.

There are different On-Demand Price Tiers for Vectorspace AI, ranging from free to institutional. How has the feedback been from potential clients using the free tier? 
-------

The feedback has been great so far, but we are not going to be issuing numbers at this time. We are strategically going to be releasing the Alpha Week article and communication by S&P global, followed by a presentation of the numbers.

What is the current revenue status?
-------

We are revenue positive, i.e., we are already doing business.

What level of user adoption can be expected by the end of 2021?
-------

We expect it to be high.

Is there any indication of when or at what stage buybacks are to be expected?
-------

Our objective is not to move tokens from the main wallet. The objective is to acquire as much VXV as we can. We will be doing this with buybacks. The ability to do so is driven by revenue generation. We will see large buybacks occur when there is consequential revenue.

In the case of someone paying $100k, is it all automated in the sense that $50k will automatically go onto the exchange and buy $50k worth of VXV?
-------

Yes, and that is where it gets interesting, we can use a few algorithms to monitor sensitivity on the ask side, sell pressure, and even a few overbought or oversold indicators, e.g., the 10 day Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator (MACD), while placing limit orders to support new legs up.

We would essentially be serving as our own Market Maker (MM) and an Ax, with a fiduciary responsibility to maintain an orderly market, which is the primary mandate for a MM, for the sake of our customers and market participants.

Will it be possible to resell subscriptions?
-------

Yes, we expect some customers will want to resell their VXV subscriptions and wallets at higher valuations to any bidder.

We also anticipate experts and specialists to come in, build powerful and unique datasets, subscribe to them and lease them out to other funds they consult with.

How will the subscriptions change value if it is worth $0,99c per minute?
-------

The value of a dataset is based on how much the customer from an industry such as life sciences or the financial markets, values the ‘signal’ that the dataset is able to produce. For a hedge fund, this ‘signal’ is represented as ‘alpha’. If you have a dataset that is generating alpha, that is how much the dataset is worth at the time.

The value of a dataset can go up or down over time based on the change in the value of the signal it generates. This is why most datasets will appreciate in value over time especially if triangulated and combined with new and existing datasets. All of this supercharges AI and ML systems in addition to being their ‘gasoline’.

Why did the token value decrease so much in the end of 2019?
-------

There was a small crypto hedge fund that held a number of positions in cryptos and ours was one of them. They blew up and ran into a few regulatory issues. They were forced to liquidate most of their holdings across the board so they could spin their fund down and likely start another. We chose to not allow them to sell into any significant news announcements. 

Does VXV keep track of relationships with American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) or only with native U.S. securities?
-------

We currently operate on native U.S. securities and markets. ADRs do not move much historically and are not as liquid as normal trading vehicles. This is a reason for why we do not include them. ADRs trade a bit differently and with less volatility. Our relationship with S&P Global allows us to operate on all global indices.

Onboarding and Subscriptions
========

How is the onboarding process for the customers that are not familiar with crypto?
-------

Currently, we are hand holding our customers on a case-by-case basis as we engage in customer onboarding and discovery. This enables feedback to be quickly flushed out enabling immediate course correction.

If companies are not willing to enter cryptocurrency markets, they have the option to pay with fiat (or their preferred currency) through our partner Trustology.  

One of the hurdles we have experienced, is related to simplifying the entire cryptocurrency onboarding effort. We learned a lot during our roadshow in New York City and we have found that most institutions simply face the difficulty with entering the cryptocurrency space to be too overwhelming. Trustology was a major component in this ongoing effort to remove friction and provide a better experience for our customers. 

What happens to the VXV in the customer’s wallet when the customer decides to stop their subscription?
-------

If a customer cancels their subscription, we are currently intending to follow best-of-breed practices used by Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others when it comes to managing ‘usage credits’ or ‘credits’ in general. Nothing is written in stone and remains fluid which means we are open to outside innovation.

Has the team considered adding a "middle man" to the ecosystem? Hybrid, crypto-based companies "leasing" their VXV to clients, thereby decreasing friction for end users who might be apprehensive to use or hold a crypto token.
-------

The VXV team does not need to do this when there are billion-dollar companies using VXV to acquire datasets which make them money. These are the kinds of middle men that the company is looking at.

Are there any plans to build Vectorspace AI’s own subscription exchange?
-------

Absolutely, for now Amazon is offering such a service asking for a 15% cut in revenue. We decided we will wait on that part. In the meantime, as soon as engineering resources are unlocked, we will place it in the pipeline.

Why the need of a token instead of a normal fiat subscription?  
-------

Machines incentivized to transact feature vectors for the purpose of minimizing loss (or increasing signal/alpha) is one of our goals. We have opened up a few of our API services to the public that will help accomplish this. At the same time, there is a small cost we absorb associated with each API call related to CPU, cloud services, bandwidth, storage etc. Using token wallet-enabled APIs enables us to rate limit, cover costs and provide unlimited tiers of services based on token amounts held in the wallet-enabled API keys. As tokens are essentially programmable, that opens up a world of possibilities in terms of funding and supporting our research, products and customers.

In addition to that, placing changes in data and changes in calculations is customer requirement and we handle via the Data Provenance Pipeline (DPP) hash as described in our VXV wallet-enabled utility token credit network on slide 10 in our main deck. Data provenance on chain combined with the fact that programmable money is key innovation. It is almost just as important for us to maintain a public trading vehicle with access to a new and truly global capital market place for ourselves and our customers. Data provenance and lineage is extremely important to our customers and to the process of constructing datasets.

Why is VXV not a stable coin pegged to the dollar? 
-------

VXV is not meant to be a currency, it is a utility token, designed to appreciate in value, like a stock. More subscribers, more coins out of circulation because the customers must have the VXV in order to power up their API calls.

Partnerships, Customers, and M&As
========

If a Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) event was to occur, what would happen to token holders? 
-------

In the case of an M&A event or strategic investment by one of our customers, or outside companies or investors, the VXV utility token will be the most valuable asset they acquire related to this company. This is if we allow any M&A in the first place of course. This is how we have financially engineered, structured and positioned Vectorspace AI.

VXV will be transacted in terms of all buyouts before the close of any M&A event, particularly an acquisition. We will allow anything else to happen but for all VXV to be transacted before a close for the following reasons:

A) This is critical for the current structure and design of the revenue model to work (which we have put a lot of thought into).
B) Critical for the core team that has been with the company for the last 18 years through thick and thin. 
D) Critical for other investors 
E) Critical for all stakeholders

Considering the potential of an acquisition by S&P Global or a similar suitor, what is stopping the acquirer from scalping out the tech and moving on with it, leaving the VXV token useless? In other words, token necessity can create frictions on the corporate side for potential clients (limited liquidity, custody issues, etc.).
-------

This is 100% impossible. The VXV token is integrated into the entire process of data provenance. There is no excising the VXV token from the model.

If the Vectorspace AI team is focused on interaction and cooperation with multi-million-dollar companies, then why gather ordinary crypto investors? What will the main application of these products be for these companies or for investors?
-------

We are not focused on interactions with multi-million-dollar companies, rather billion- and trillion-dollar companies. This also includes trader bases interested in trading VXV. The definition of IR (Investor relations) answers this as well. Both companies and investors have access to datasets which are used to generate Smart Baskets.


Will VXV still be needed and remain valuable if the traditional market gets hit with a bear market?
-------

We are hedged in more ways than one.  We are offering, e.g.:

a) Short Smart Baskets of traditional where some will be hedged with options or long on the SPYs. 
b) We will have an entire offering of Long Smart Baskets of crypto. 
c) Long crypto, short traditional hybrid Smart Baskets. 
d) Datasets are customized to whatever the client wants. 
e) We will be additionally hedged by initially offering datasets in the Life Science industry. 
f) Any other industry. 

It Is good to be in AI.

How will VXV prioritize data access among users, keeping in mind that alpha could be fully exploited by the first mover thus rendering the data moot?
-------

There are unlimited ways a dataset can be created and unlimited ways one can construct a Smart Basket from a particular dataset. We have been in the business of datasets for a very long time. This means that other companies are attracted to what we do because it gives them an edge and a way to attract more customers to their platforms. They rely on us to do this.

Signal to noise extraction especially in NLP/NLU is about the variety of data sources, the data engineering pipeline and how you calculate scores for feature attributes within vectors in addition to many different ways you can calculate distance between vectors.

Most alpha is extracted from the data engineering pipeline in combination with trade execution methods. Data engineers know exactly how to “create clusters” and do all the different kinds of things to extract value from a dataset.

How many datasets is Vectorspace AI able to provide?
-------

Billions. How many events, topics or categories are there in the world? Multiply that figure by how many ‘contexts’ exist in the world. Now, multiply that figure by how many ‘row types’ you can think of, e.g., cryptos, stocks, genes, proteins, chemicals, antiviral compounds, diseases, therapeutics, phytochemicals, plant compounds, etc.


Who are the competitors of Vectorspace AI?
-------

In the crypto market, there are none. In the traditional, our closest competitors are Motif Investing (however, they do it like Pandora does music, manually), Palantir, Blackrock, Rencap, and Google. 

We do not have competitors yet that provide NLU correlation matrix datasets used to generate clusters from unsupervised data using vector space methods.

What places Vectorspace AI ahead of its competitors?
-------

-	 First to market
-	algorithmic calculations
-	strategy wrapped around technology
-	knowledge expertise in the public markets, 
-	and decades of experience in data science (previously known as data/knowledge/text mining and epigraphy) and data engineering.

The VXV approach for those platforms is unique in the industry for dataset exposure in several ways. These trade secrets also double as our moats and barrier to entry along with a hedge.

There will be tons of competition in the future but the dataset industry is so large that there are tons of different dataset types. Our datasets are advanced and focus on NLU which is one of the most valuable niches. We will then be expanding into datasets of all types including the ones you find on www.kaggle.com. The most important thing to keep in mind is that every industry now benefits from data, ML/AI/NLP/NLU. We will be moving into every industry vertical possible.

Some of the potential partnerships/collaborations that have been in the works during the last months: S&P Global, Neudata, CloudQuant, Microsoft, Bloomberg, GNC.

How do the collaborations with Microsoft, Amazon, and S&P Global work?
-------

For Amazon and Microsoft, it is different than with Bloomberg or S&P Global. The former are also different from one another as Amazon's AWS is more mature. Microsoft has a different customer base and culture. On the Amazon side, we have the life sciences and COVID-19 datasets. They want to group us with other companies which is based on their timing based on their life sciences focus. Microsoft will be a general focus and has an investment arm that the team will be pursuing as well. PR will likely be released by them and both Amazon/MSFT will produce case studies.

What is the current status on the pending Public Relations (PR) with Amazon, Microsoft, S&P Global etc.?
-------

They are in progress and that is all we can say at this time.

Would Ocean Protocol not be an interesting partner for Vectorspace AI? Ocean offers data marketplaces, e.g., for healthcare (e.g., they collaborate with Roche). Vectorspace AI could thus either become a vendor of datasets on the ocean marketplace, or acquire proprietary data from other vendors for their datasets. 
-------

Yes, they would be but time and resources are currently focused on revenue generation at this time.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is the big hype currently in the blockchain space. Could we see DeFi protocols using Vectorspace AI datasets and Smart Baskets for financial products in the future?
-------

Absolutely.
